We are going to extend ButtonPanel.java class because right now, there is no button for undo.
We will add a createUndoButton() function, and an undo() function, which when called, will invoke the the undo function in our UndopacmanInteraction class, and enables/disable start/stop button.


We are going to create an UndoablePacmanInteraction class which extends PacmanInteraction.java.   We will add a state for undoing, and an undo() function which will move the player and the ghosts back to their previous location. 


We are going to create an UndoableGame class which extends Game.java.  It will include a stack which will remember pacman's location and score and ghost location.  It will have a undo() function which calls the undo function in UndoablePacmanInteraction and passes the variables in our stack to it.

Lastly, we will have a UndoablePacman class which extends MainUI, but with the added functionality of undo.
