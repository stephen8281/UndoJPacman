ButtonPanelWithUndo's undo function and UndoablePacman's main function are not tested.
UndoablePacman's button panel creation code isn't fully tested.

Testing the undo button callback is difficult to do automatically as it has to be done by clicking the button.
Testing the ButtonPanelWithUndo's undo function is impossible without breaking some encapsulation.
The original jpacman-framework tests do not cover this kind of things either so we think it's ok if we don't have automated tests for them.
