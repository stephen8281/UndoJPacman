A JAVA Jpacman game that supports undo

•	Added an undo feature to an existing Pacman-like game to allow players to undo their moves any time during the game using a test-driven development model

•	Followed the agile software development guidelines which included writing user stories, designing UML diagram, and holding weekly scrum meetings 

•	Wrote JUnit tests for each user story and made sure they failed at first.  Extended the original project using Maven dependency and implemented the new feature in java to pass one test at a time

•	Cooperated with a team of three students, gained experience with using GitHub, and understood the advantages of agile approach versus the traditional waterfall approach in this kind of project
