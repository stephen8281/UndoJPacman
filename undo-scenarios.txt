STORY 7 - UNDO
As a player, I want to be able to undo a move I regret, including all ghost moves made since my last move, so that I can continue the game in the state just before my last move.

Scenario 7.1 - move to empty square
Given the game is in progress
And the player's last move was to an empty square
When the play undos
Then pacman moves to the last position before the last player move
And all ghosts move to where they were before the last player move
And the score remains unchanged

Scenario 7.2 - move to food
Given the game is in progress
And the player's last move was to a square occupied by food
When the play undos
Then pacman moves to the last position before the last player move
And all ghosts move to where they were before the last player move
And the score rolls back
And the food reappears

Scenario 7.3 - game over
Given the player got killed by a ghost
When the play undos
Then pacman moves to the last position before the last player move
And all ghosts move to where they were before the last player move
And the game continues
And the score remains unchanged

Scenario 7.4 - player won
Given the player has eaten all the food and won
When the player undos
Then pacman moves to the position before the last player move
And all ghosts move to where they were before the last player move
And the game continues
And the score rolls back
And the food reappears

Scenario 7.5 - hitting a wall
Given the player's last move was toward a wall
When the player undos
Then pacman moves to the last position before the last valid player move
And all ghosts move to where they were before the last valid player move
And if the last valid player move was toward a food, the food reappears and the score rolls back

Scenario 7.6 - tunnel
Given the player's last move was through a tunnel (overflow)
When the player undos
The player should appear on the other side of the tunnel
And all ghosts move to where they were before the last player move
And if the last valid player move was toward a food, the food reappears and the score rolls back
And if the last valid player move was toward a ghost, the game continues
